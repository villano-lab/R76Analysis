# This is a default/example 'cuts' file for use with cut_data.py.
# It will INCLUDE only data which matches each cut.
# The substrings it's looking for are:
# names: x[", "]
# if you attempt to condition differently (e.g. "and" statements instead of newlines) or use alternate versions of these characters (e.g. using '' intead of ""), the parser will probably get confused, so be careful.
#Each line is a separate condition. You will only output data that matches ALL lines.

#EventCategory == 0 #Nonrandom events only #If we enable this we won't get cut files for randoms.
