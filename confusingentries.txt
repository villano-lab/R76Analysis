07221023_1051 looks like NaI data but says DCRC1pA 2
07221022_1630 same. they both say 'NaI window not fixed' maybe that's the issue
07221021_1001 strange vertical artifact after correction, and data are mostly negative...
07220924_1233 lines aren't clear enough to identify. Tried picking a few different lines but no luck.
